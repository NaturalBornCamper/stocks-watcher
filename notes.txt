TODO:
-Make the DecayCompiledQuant algorithm
 One with decay value going down with 1/x or quadratic function (Or maybe a bit less strong? 1/x might be perfect though)
-Make the other quant views
 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/urls/#passing-extra-options-to-view-functions
 Quant page for a month, so I can basically see the same data as Excel, but split it different tables on the same page instead of one long table
 Average "quant" column of the Quant table for each stock instead of my own custom score
 Quant page for a certain stock, that will show its rank for each month, so I can have the details for a stock
  Showing the history of each type of quant it was in
 Quant page for a specific type. Not sure how the data will show on the page, TBD
 Page for average of each category.
  For example top technology, all stocks that were in at least once have the total time they were in, the average of each column, their calculated rank
-Quant views changes
 Menu to open each quant view
 Filter to show minimum score/count in at least one of the types to show a stock in the list. Right now there are 3313.. too much
  Min score 50 by default I think. I can always show all with a button
 Filter/search for stock
 (All these filters and options will be different according to the quant view also)



-Add Zacks monthly top 5. Or top 10? Also free 30 days


-Quant auto-grabber
 Should be able to grab all URLs in a list, then copy the first 100 rows, then output in a csv
 Might need to be in Javascript, like a chrome extension that will open all links and generate


-Alerts rework
 Problem = need alerts with different columns
  Alerts when price hits above or less X$
  Alerts when price changes +/- X% since last day (Would be nice if a single alert can be only one direction or both)
  Alerts when price is highest/lowest in minimum X days (Would be nice if a single alert can be only one direction or both)
 Solutions
  Make a main alert table, with a sub table for each alert type?


-Quant Data structure possible rework
 Google sheets
  A sheet per quant type?
   +Maximum amount of sheets
   +No need to have a column for quant type
   -Big reorganization, might need a script to reorganize
 Django tables (Not sure it's needed, or that it's a good idea. I feel it will make queries more difficult)
   A table per quant type? If I choose to do this, they can all be moved in there later
   A table per month? Nope
   A table where all are mixed? Already like this


-Log system
 Make log function like Swarm Control, with level
 Log all prints better in function
