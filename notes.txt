STEPS ASAP:
-Alerts
 Make a model for "less than x days" and "more than x days" alerts
 AND a model for "target prices", so they are not all mixed up
 And I can set a >30 days with a note (Buy VOO if extra unused money), as well as a >60 days for another note (buy VOO for kids for example)
-Find way to make a secondary alert system
 Only one DB entry per stock, so maybe put it directly in the stock?
 Have a float value for How many minimum days to check for highest value, and another for lowest value
  Makes sense directly in stock, then a null value means no alert? At the same time time not because alerts should be in an alert
 Has checkboxes maybe, to activate when prices change for 5% 10% 15%
  Not sure 3 checkboxes is good, need to find a way to make it a custom value but still not have 3 alerts to create to have 3%, 5% and 7%
-Make different quant compilations
 One with decay value going down linearly
 One with decay value going down with 1/x function (Or maybe a bit less strong? 1/x might be perfect though)


-Todo/sort/ideas from messenger
 Have page for stock quant details, showing the history of each type of quant it was in
 Have page showing average "quant" column of the Quant table for each stock instead of my own custom score
 Page for average of each category.
  For example top technology, all stocks that were in at least once have the total time they were in, the average of each column, their calculated rank
 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/urls/#passing-extra-options-to-view-functions
 Add Zacks monthly top 5. Or top 10? Also free 30 days
-Quant ratings
 What I want to see
  A score per stock
   100-rank august 2023 + 100-rank august 2022 + ... = score for each time stock is in the quant
    Sometimes I will get quand once per year, sometimes once per month, sometimes at the beginning and end of month. So find a way to calculate that
  When a stock has been X times in quant, X times in value, X time in top tech, etc
 DB
  tables
   A table per quant type? If I choose to do this, they can all be moved in there later
   A table per month? Nope
   A table where all are mixed?
-Need a way to clear prices for a stock (when there was a split for example)
 Maybe in Django admin, can have a filter instead of just list all prices from all stocks? But then we'd need also to have more than 100 per page (Maybe not, looks like there's a "show all". For example at the bottom of game library: admin/library/game/?other=no_tag&platforms__id__exact=11


-Log system
 Make log function like Swarm Control, with level
 Log all prints better in function
-Database
 Add "notes" in alert, so that I remember why I made it and it tells me in email. What about cheapest in at least x days though? Need notes on this one too, maybe just make unique key [stock, xdays, lessthan]? Dirty.. find a way
